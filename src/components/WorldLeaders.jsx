                        The University of Nicosia (UNIC) has an almost decade-long track record
                        as the leading university in the field of cryptocurrency and blockchain.
                        UNIC launched the world’s first degree program in cryptocurrency in
                        2014.
                        <br/>
                        Today, UNIC has educated over 100,000 students in academic and
                        professional training courses, hosts the world’s largest team of faculty
                        and staff focused on crypto-assets and blockchains.
                        <br/>
                        UNIC serves as the academic lead for the EU Blockchain Observatory and
                        Forum (a European Commission initiative to accelerate the development of
                        blockchain within the EU) and also was selected to serve on the
                        Technology Advisory Board of the European Central Bank (ECB).
                        <br/>
                        UNIC runs the Decentralized conference, Europe’s premier annual
                        blockchain conference since 2017. The growing Decentralized network now
                        comprises 19 chapters with 55,000+ members from over 100 countries.
