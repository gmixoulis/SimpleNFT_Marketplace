# Full-Stack NFT Marketplace

## 🛒 Project Overview

**SimpleNFT Marketplace** is a production-ready Decentralized Application (dApp) for trading digital assets. Unlike simple tutorials, this project includes a robust **DevOps pipeline** with Docker and Nginx, making it suitable for scalable deployment. It features a sophisticated frontend built with **TypeScript** and **React**, integrated with smart contracts.

## 🔑 Key Features

- **Production DevOps**: Dockerized environment with `nginx` as a reverse proxy for high performance.
- **Type-Safe Frontend**: Large-scale **TypeScript** codebase (100+ files) ensuring reliability and maintainability.

- **CI/CD Ready**: Includes `appspec.yml` for AWS CodeDeploy integration.

## 🛠️ Tech Stack & Skills

- **Frontend**: React, TypeScript, Tailwind CSS
- **DevOps**: Docker, Docker Compose, Nginx, AWS CodeDeploy
- **Build Tool**: Webpack
- **Blockchain**: Ethereum / EVM (Implied integration)

## 💡 Innovation

This workspace transitions from "coding" to **"Engineering"**. The inclusion of Nginx configurations, Docker orchestration, and TypeScript demonstrates a readiness for building maintainable, enterprise-level Web3 software.
